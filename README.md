In this machine learning project, we will recognize handwritten characters, i.e., English letter sets from A-Z. This we will accomplish by displaying a neural network that should be prepared over a dataset containing pictures of letter sets. Handwriting recognition is the capacity of a machine to get and decipher handwritten contribution from various sources like paper reports, photos, contact screen gadgets and so on Recognition of handwritten and machine characters is an arising zone of examination and finds broad applications in banks, workplaces and ventures. This application is valuable for recognizing all character (English) given as in info picture. When information picture of character is given to proposed framework, at that point it will recognize input character which is given in picture. Recognition and order of characters are finished by Neural Network.
